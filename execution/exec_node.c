//Execution Flow for Pipe commands:
//Pipe Detected: execute_node() → fork_for_pipe()
//Fork Two Child Processes:
//Left child handles the left command.
//Right child handles the right command.
//Set up Pipe Redirection:
//Left child: Redirects STDOUT to the pipe.
//Right child: Redirects STDIN from the pipe.
//For Command Execution:
//Each child calls execute_node(), which eventually leads to 
//exec_simple_cmd() and execve() for the command on its side.
//Each command in the pipeline is executed in its respective child process.
//pipe commands get executed in the child processes created in fork_for_pipe(), 
//and execve() is called from within each child process after 
//redirections are set up,just like non-pipe commands. 
//The difference is that the pipe setup happens first, 
//before reaching the execve() call
